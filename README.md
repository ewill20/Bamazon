This is an interactive Node.js shopping app where MySQL stores the information on products, products sold, profits, sales, etc.  

Customer Portal

The customer portal allows a shopper to see the items for sale and quickly purchase them by entering the product ID for the item desired.

Manager Portal

Executive Portal

This section allows the "executive" to view product sales by department or create a new department.  Choosing product sales by department shows the Dept ID, Department Name, Overhead Costs, Total Sales, and Total Profits.  The latter option allows one to enter the department name and subsequently the overhead costs for that department.  It is the manager's duty to enter products into this department.
